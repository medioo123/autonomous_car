The best model for the autopilot was created in autonomous_car/SupervisedNotebooks/

You can check how the car was communicating with the Raspberry and our mobile Application in code_car.

The road simulator helped us create some of the dataset and was taken from :  https://github.com/vinzeebreak/road_simulator
